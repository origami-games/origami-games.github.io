### Summary
Pixies are a hostile, flying entity. They attack fly down, attack you twice with 4 HP (2 hearts) of damage and go away again - enough to kill an unarmoured player. They have 16 HP (8 hearts) themselves.

### Technical Summary
Pixies comprise of a bat, a silverfish and an armour stand. The bat is used for the flying mechanic, and can be killed separately from the silverfish, causing the silverfish to drop to the ground as an earthbound entity. The armour stand is used for the custom name and texture.
