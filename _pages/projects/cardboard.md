# Cardboard
Cardboard is a Minecraft development API made especially for [Origami Games](https://origami-games.github.io).

### How do I use Cardboard?
The Cardboard API consists of a collection of tag-based hooks that you can reference in your pack:

#### `#cardboard:tick`
Runs every tick.

#### `#cardboard:player/tick`
Runs on the player every tick.

#### `#cardboard:load`
Runs every time the pack loads.

#### `#cardboard:hook/action_detection/right_click`
Runs on players who have right-clicked with a carrot on a stick.

#### `#cardboard:hook/death`
Runs on players who have died.

#### `#cardboard:hook/drown`
Runs on players who are taking drowning damage.
