intro:
  - excerpt: "'Artefact', is an RPG created in vanilla Minecraft, for singleplayer. It takes place in a vibrant fantasy world with both sandbox and story gameplay. The map is not realistic or gritty, itâ€™s fun for the sake of fun. The combat will make you feel like a badass and the story is full of interest not typically found in large-scale fantasy."

### How can I play Artefact?
Artefact is still in quite early development. We are trying so hard to get it complete as soon as possible, but it still means that you'll have to wait a while for release. The map will come out in a kind of 'beta release' phase, for you to [test and find bugs](https://github.com/origami-games/artefact/issues). As soon as it is polished like a good block of andesite, the map will be fully released.

### Why only singleplayer?
Based on all of our aims, multiplayer compatibility is simply not an option in vanilla. There are certain aspects, such as per-player quests, that could not be achieved in plain, un-modded Minecraft. In addition to this, every different player has separate progress. You can't show one player that a block/entity is in one place and not show it to other players, like do most Minecraft MMORPGs do.

### How can we help?
The easiest way to give help and feedback would be to [send us a message on our Discord](https://discord.gg/k7gRYYY) or [open an issue through GitHub](https://github.com/origami-games/artefact/issues/new/choose). Expect a response in up to a day!
