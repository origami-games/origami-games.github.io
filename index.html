excerpt: Origami Studios is a map development group
intro:
  - excerpt: "Our first map, Imperius' Return, is an RPG created in vanilla Minecraft, for singleplayer. It takes place in a vibrant fantasy world with both sandbox and story gameplay. The map is not realistic or gritty, itâ€™s fun for the sake of fun. The combat will make you feel like a badass and the story is full of interest not typically found in large-scale fantasy."
